I used the "Controlling & Querying Video Objects" example to upload my own video of the subway, changed the size of the ellipse, the background color, as well as the size of the canvas. The sketch gets information about the video as itâ€™s playing, and the user is also able to pause and unpause the video by clicking the mouse. The video has volume, and there's an interactive element in being able to control when the video plays depending on the user's manipulation of the mouse.
